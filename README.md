AIr QUALITY PREDICTION


The dataset containing various meterological and air quality parameter.An Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) was performed to visualize relationship between different features of the dataset.
Various machine learning models such as linear Regression ,Gradiant boosting algorithm, Decision tree were developed and evaluated via metrics such r2_score ,mean absolute error,mean squared error,
using scikit learn library python.Gradient Boosting models were observed to perform best on the dataset.
